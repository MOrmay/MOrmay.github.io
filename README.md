I grew up in Loxton, a country town about 3 hours from Adelaide where I attended high school and completed year 12. I have played field hockey continuously since primary school and despite having played that long, I play in the second lowest grade for Adelaide Uni.
 
#Interest in IT

Growing up there was always a computer in the house. At a young age I was introduced to the computer through a piece of software called Ruff’s Bone. From here computers remained a steady interest but always something just to be used. Outside of my general use of computers to complete assignments, play games and browse the internet.

I have almost no experience in IT. I have never received formal training or taken the time to try and teach myself some things. 

I chose to come to RMIT through Open Universities as what I was studying previously in Adelaide has not worked out.  

Through coming to RMIT I hope to gain a better understanding of what it takes to program and how programs operate. As well as a broader idea of what is available in the IT industry. 

#Ideal Job

Cyber Security Engineer/Architect

The duties this position performs is ensuring data is accessed, transferred or copied in a safe way that is beneficial the company. This may involve monitoring certain projects and limiting or granting access depending on where people are within the company. 

This role appeals to me as I have a cursory interest in security and the methods that are employed to keep data private and safe. 

To be considered for this job I need a considerable amount of experience and education. Multiple years of experience with other employers in certain fields/environments similar to this company.  

Currently I do not possess the knowledge or skills to perform this job. The only qualifications I possess are my SACE certificate and a few completed university subjects. 

My plan is to complete the first six months of this course and consider either continuing with RMIT or to transfer to UNI SA into their IT and security degree they offer. Somewhere around years two or three hopefully I can get some work experience to bolster my chances of finding a job after completing a degree.

Being classified as an INFP I am less likely to want to take on a leadership role and instead take more of a backseat role trying to make sure the project stays close to the original idea. As a visual learner I do quite well learning things by watching them happen, reading and taking notes and, from personal experience, by repeating or doing what was just demonstrated for myself. As I will most likely need to be adept at coding or at least have a good understanding of it for future assignments I will need to take this information into account whilst I am learning. 

Whilst in a team I am likely to go with the flow to keep people happy with their vision of the project. If the project is an idea I like I may get carried away and do too much on it or add too much "personal touch" that gets in the way of the overall function. As I am a visual based person if there is something in the project that I don't understand but would like to grasp better it would be best if I had someone walk me through it with a copy in front of me. 

Knowing that I may not be a natural leader it would be wise to make sure that someone who might be was included in the group. Due to my ideals it would also be best if I was in a group that have a similar vision or feelings as myself and are visual based people as well. 

#Project Idea

Heatmaps are an interesting and easy way to present the distribution of population in an area. In an ever-growing online world, more people have phones with wireless capabilities. As it seems most people don’t deactivate their WIFI when they leave home, the idea of this project is to distribute a network of small, wireless detecting chipsets throughout a city to give a city council an idea of where its populace spends its time for its marketing, development and financial team. 

This idea comes about from a post online about how a university in the US uses a similar technology to monitor the number of students in areas of their library to help those entering to find empty places to study. The information gleamed from this system may help the city in funding problem areas, marketing "hidden gems" or help emergency services to get idea of how many people are likely to be affected or surrounding the area on the ground level. 

The premise of the idea is to have hundreds of units scattered throughout the city detecting the outgoing WIFI pings of mobile devices. Each node would then at predetermined intervals, for example 10-15 minutes, note how many different IDs over approximately 10 seconds it detects then send that data to a server. Each device would then have a unique identifier itself and location registered so that it can then be used to produce a heatmap of where the general population is throughout the city. Each unit would be an enclosed device requiring one cable out for power and either sending data out through that wire or WIFI if available. 

Each chipset would feature a small processor, some memory and a WIFI module. Power would be provided through a standard RJ45/CAT5 connector. The enclosure for the chipset would be as small of a form factor as possible to not draw attention to itself. Two versions of the case would be available, an indoor variant that is to prevent accidental damage to the unit and an outdoor one that is weather proof and is paintable. Both versions will have mounting options so that they may be affixed to surfaces easily. 

Security and privacy are quite a concern as this system has the potential to be misused. As such data saved by each device should be kept to a minimum and no identifying information should be sent to the main server. Another issue with this idea is what happens in multistory buildings as the signals their phones put out enter the area of a device and instead of moving horizontally into another detection area, escape it by moving vertically to their work. This issue seems to be unavoidable without breaching people's privacy and tracking their phones ID throughout the city with where they leave and reenter the network.  

Each device would consist of an Arduino and a wireless/WIFI chip or specialty made chipset. These would then be placed throughout the city and connected either through a business's WIFI with some compensation for data use and power through reduced land tax or directly or, as a standalone piece installed by the city. A protective shell will have to be designed with a weatherproof version for units installed in external areas.  

To produce such a scheme having city council approval is a must. This would mean convincing them that this would be worth the time and money to invest and that it would pay for itself long-term. On the software side a good understanding of networks, data manipulation and databases would be required to present the data in a readable fashion. Each unit's code should be written in such a way that only the number of detected devices are sent to the server. 

Acquiring the people to produce this would require someone with management experience and connections. Software engineers with wireless experience would be required for the coding of the devices. Whilst other engineers with experience in data processing, management and statistics would be required to make the incoming data useable and worthwhile. A final front end engineer has to be acquired so that the data that is acquired is presentable, easy to understand and navigate. Council workers, with some training, could install most of the units, some may otherwise require people with experience to install. Producing the units could be made to order after initial planning of how many are required.  

After this has been implemented the council will have more information of how people move throughout the city at a higher resolution than may be possible with a city WIFI. If made available to the public, it may allow businesses to make more informed decisions about where they want to set up leading to better competition.
